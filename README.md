# Game-Framework
Intended to be a barebones engine containing minimal required features to get a game going. Because I'm constantly developing new "minimal" features in other codebases, this should be regularly updated.

This was my first serious-ish pet project from a development perspective, and I'm still updating it ~4 years later. As such, it pretty much has the full breadth of my development in it, which means some of it is really bad, amateur, poorly written, doesn't follow best practices, etc. One day I'll refactor it all.
